# Create Unlimited (not addon)

basically just Create Unlimited, but instead as a modified version of base Create

configs are integrated, so nothing separate

remember to REPLACE create with this in your mods folder

This branch is for: fabric 1.18.2

installation (for most up-to-date, but more unstable builds): https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/downloading-workflow-artifacts

otherwise just download the latest release
